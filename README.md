# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data from **3,900 purchases** across various product categories. The goal is to uncover insights into spending patterns, customer segments, product preferences, and subscription behavior to guide strategic business decisions.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Rows:** 3,900
- **Columns:** 18
- **Key Features:**
  - Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status)
  - Purchase details (Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Size, Color)
  - Shopping behavior (Discount Applied, Previous Purchases, Frequency, Review Rating, Shipping Type)
- **Missing Data:** 37 values in the Review Rating column

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **MySQL** – Database integration and SQL queries
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation

## 🔍 Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation & Cleaning (Python)
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Handled missing values in `Review Rating` using median imputation per category
- Renamed columns to snake_case for consistency
- Created new features:
  - `age_group` (Young Adult, Adult, Middle-aged, Senior)
  - `purchase_frequency_days`
- Removed redundant column (`promo_code_used`)

### 2. Database Integration
- Connected Python to **MySQL** using `mysql-connector-python`
- Created a table `shopping_behavior` in MySQL
- Loaded cleaned DataFrame into the database

### 3. SQL Analysis (MySQL)
Performed the following business queries in a single SQL file:

**Key Analyses:**
1. **Revenue by Gender** – Total revenue generated by male vs. female customers
2. **High-Spending Discount Users** – Customers who used discounts but spent above average
3. **Top 5 Products by Rating** – Products with highest average review ratings
4. **Shipping Type Comparison** – Average purchase amounts between Standard and Express shipping
5. **Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers** – Average spend and total revenue comparison
6. **Discount-Dependent Products** – Top 5 products with highest percentage of discounted purchases
7. **Customer Segmentation** – Classified customers into New, Returning, and Loyal segments
8. **Top 3 Products per Category** – Most purchased products within each category
9. **Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions** – Correlation between repeat purchases (>5) and subscription status
10. **Revenue by Age Group** – Total revenue contribution of each age group

### 4. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
Built an interactive dashboard including:
- Key metrics: Number of customers, average purchase amount, average review rating
- Revenue breakdown by category and age group
- Subscription status distribution
- Customer segmentation visualization
- Shipping type comparison

## 📈 Key Insights
1. **Young Adults** contribute the most revenue
2. **Express shipping** users spend more on average than standard shipping users
3. **Subscribers** and **non-subscribers** have similar average spend, but non-subscribers generate more total revenue
4. **Hats, Sneakers, and Coats** are the most discount-dependent products
5. **Loyal customers** make up the majority of the customer base (3,116 out of 3,900)

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- **Boost Subscriptions** – Offer exclusive benefits for subscribers
- **Loyalty Programs** – Reward repeat buyers to move them into the "Loyal" segment
- **Review Discount Strategy** – Balance discount offers with margin control
- **Product Positioning** – Highlight top-rated and best-selling items in marketing campaigns
- **Targeted Marketing** – Focus efforts on high-revenue age groups (Young Adults) and express-shipping users
